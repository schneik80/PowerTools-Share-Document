# Share Menu

## Description

Sharing is core to collaborative design. The Share Menu makes it easier to access sharing tools.

**Get Share Link** enables sharing, generates a public share link with Downloads enabled and then copies the link to the system clipboard. You can then paste into text or emails to quickly share the document.

Note:
The document must be saved, and your Fusion Team Hub must have enabled share links for sharing to work. If sharing is disabled, a private permalink will be copied to clipboard instead. This link will only allow Team hub members access to the document details page.

The share message will display additional information as needed:

- The document was already shared.
- The document share link is password protected.
- If download is enabled for the shared document.
- If the document has external references, information on if the references can be downloaded or only viewed is also noted.

**Change Share Settings** allows you to adjust the active documents share settings from the same menu.

Settings control:

- Turn sharing on and off.
- Turn permission to download the shared document on and off.
- Add a password to protect the share link

If download is turned off, the recipient of the link will only be able to view the document.

**Get Open on Desktop link**

Within your team you may want different links for different collaborators. While public share links work well for external members to view a design and for extended team members to access a document in Fusion's web client; it is not great to share a document amongst your design team all working in Autodesk Fusion in the same Hub.. Collaborating with authors and editors on documents is improved with the **Get Open on Desktop Link** command. When sent to other Fusion desktop client users, these links directly open the document for edit in the Desktop Client.

The use of these links requires that the team member be a member of the hub and have permission to the document.

**Invite to project**

If you need to add additional team members or colaborators to the active document. **Invite to Project...** opens Autodesk Fusion Team web client to the folder containing the active document. From here you can directly invite new colaborators who then will be available to you to set access permissions.  You need appropriet permisions to do this. If you do not, you will not be able to invite. Contact you Team/Compaony's Fusion Hub amin to discuss.


**Document Project Members...**

Quickly open Autodesk Fusion Team web client to the folder containing the active document and see the list of users and groups with access. From here you ca directly invite new colaborators or add, remove, modify access permissions.  You need appropriet permisions to do this. If you do not, you will not be able to invite. Contact you Team/Compaony's Fusion Hub amin to discuss.
